This is a project on creating a model for question-answering on the Quora QA Dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/toughdata/quora-question-answer-dataset). <br>
Models using GPT2 and T5 were trained, and the final model selected was GPT2. <br> <br>

The codes for both of them are attached here. It was implemented in Python programming language, 
using libraries torch, transformers, matplotlib, pandas, nltk, re. Install these libraries before running the codes.

I could not upload the saved models here because the models
were exceeding the upload limit of 25 MB.
The report and presentation mention the entire detail.

Thank you
